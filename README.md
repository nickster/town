WHAT IS THIS??
--------------

The straight explanation: This script simulates a town of people living their lives, making decisions, planning, reacting, and evolving over time.

The buzzowrd explanation: This is an agent-based model of a simple society. It incorporate rudimentary implementations of concepts in identity and persoanlity development, such as genetics, social psychology, habit formation, and behavior change, as well as microeconomics, to produce rich interactions and depth at the system's macro-level. Emphasis is also placed on simple modeling of the structures and processes of the human mind, for example, focus, the conscious and subconscious, and memory.

WHERE IS IT GOING?
-----------------

Short-term:

	Core logic
	The town will be observable through a top-down map, with agents annotated by demographics, emotional state, current activity. A real-time log of notable events will also be displayed.

Long-term: 

	A.I.!!! John would be so proud.

Learning-based: Agents access their memories to borrow strategies to accomplish goals. Memories include media and what they have observed of others.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
------------------

	o When adding a new dimension to the simulation, don't add more than two properties to it at first. For example, no more than two jobs, no more than two personality traits, etc. Get the basic recipe down before scaling it up.

	o Resist the urge to perfectly mirror our real-world. Create new behaviors, concepts, and simplify. Minecraft is fun because it has it's own rules, own language. The world is relatable yet alien, and thus exciting.

	o Take breaks to learn more about proper syntax, programming practices, and then improve the code
